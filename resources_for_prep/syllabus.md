<a name="Description"></a>
### Course Description
Quantitative and computational methods are increasingly essential to all sub-disciplines of modern biological research. The goal of this intensive week-long “boot camp” is to empower students with the fundamental skills to apply these methods, as well as connect them to resources for further developing their knowledge and abilities. The class starts at 10 am with formal instruction ending at 5 pm daily. The course demonstrates the importance of version control, documentation, testing, and other methods for enhancing reproducibility, reliability, and useability of software. This is achieved through live coding sessions and use of learning exercises, where for the majority of the class, students perform data analysis to address biological questions and reinforce core bioinformatic concepts. Upon completing the course, students should be comfortable using and writing software to work with large-scale biological data. The motivation of this goal is to **develop computational and statistical competence** in preparation for courses, rotations, thesis research, and careers. Rather than blindly outsourcing bioinformatic components of their work, **students will be empowered** to understand methodological details and their associated advantages and limitations. This will in turn advance the broader goal of rigor in experimental design, promoting robust and unbiased results.

<a name="Objectives"></a>
### Specific Objectives
  * Develop **comfort** working within a UNIX environment and at the command line to build and run programs
  * Develop **confidence** using Python and its extended ecosystem of tools for bioinformatic data analysis and visualization
  * Develop **knowledge** of standard bioinformatic file formats and where they fit within the context of a project
  * Develop **appreciation** for and **practice** of concise and transparent presentation of data
  * Develop **fluency** in basic statistical tests, associated assumptions, and interpretation of their output
  * Develop **good habits for ensuring reproducible research**

<a name="StudyMats"></a>
### Study Materials
This course does not have a required text. Any lecture notes or slides will be made available on the course website. Asynchronous videos lectures will likely be posted to YouTube and linked on the course website. Recordings of interactive lectures will be posted to a private OneDrive to which only students, instructors, and TAs will be granted access.

<a name="Format"></a>
## Course Format

<a name="BootcampFirst"></a>
### No Other Meetings
Due to the intense nature of this course, there is a strict policy that students **cannot participate in any other meetings, courses, or lab work throughout the week.** If a student foresees problems with this, they should contact a TA immediately so that this policy can be communicated to the necessary parties.

<a name="Sessions"></a>
### Types of Sessions
The course is broke into four main **types of sessions**

<a name="FormatAsynch"></a>
1. <ins>Asynchronous **Video** Lecture Sessions</ins>
    * These sessions consist of short, pre-recorded videos that introduce the lecture topic and relevant background information. The videos will be posted to YouTube (or a similar platform) and linked on the course website.
    * Students are responsible for watching and taking notes on these sessions, as they will not be hosted on Zoom.
    * Students will have the opportunity to ask questions about the videos through, Slack or once the class reconvenes on Zoom for the following Interactive Session.
<a name="FormatInter"></a>
2. <ins>**Interactive** Lecture & **Live-Coding** Sessions</ins>
    * These sessions will be held through Zoom and consist of interactive lectures and instructor-guided live-coding examples, which introduce and expand on material for the exercise sessions that occur directly afterward.
    * Students should mute themselves while instructors are presenting unless involved in discussion or debugging.
    * We ask that students join breakout rooms when asked and to use video in the breakout room if possible.
    * The instructor will pause periodically to invite questions, let students catch up, and solicit Slack check-ins. See the next syllabus section, [Asking for help](#Help), on more specific information pertaining to questions and debugging in these sessions.
    * These sessions will be recorded and posted to the private course OneDrive.
<a name="FormatExercise"></a>
3. <ins>**Exercise** Sessions (Lunch and Homework)</ins>
    * These sessions will be held through three Zoom meetings, each hosted by a TA. Students are randomly split into pairs and assigned to one of the three meetings. In the meeting, pairs are sent to breakout rooms where they work together on the exercises.
    * We encourage students to turn on their video if possible and utilize screen sharing to debug or discuss with their partners.
    * While partners are expected to have very similar answers, students should put in individualized effort and strive to understand every line of code and analysis step they take. See the [Academic Integrity & Ethics](#Integrity) syllabus section for more information.
    * Course-wide announcements and updates during these sessions will be posted to Slack.
    * See the next syllabus section, [Asking for help](#Help), on more specific information pertaining to questions and debugging in these sessions.
    * These sessions will not be recorded.
<a name="FormatPres"></a>
4. <ins>Student **Presentation** Sessions</ins>
    * These sessions will be hosted through Zoom. Pairs of students will informally present their code and results from the most recent exercise.
    * Instructors will provide feedback, and invite questions and discussion among the whole class on alternative approaches and solutions.
    * Students should mute themselves unless presenting or participating in the discussion. We also ask that students turn on their video if possible to create a more welcoming environment for the students presenting.
    * These sessions will be recorded and posted to the private OneDrive.
    * Presentations are **ungraded**
    * Typically, these sessions precede the asynchronous video sessions.

<a name="DaySchedule"></a>
### Daily Schedule
Some mornings or afternoons may be fully interactive, with no asynchronous sessions. We will let you know this in advance through Slack. However, the **daily schedule** will generally be:
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan=2>Morning</th>
            <th colspan=2>Afternoon</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>10:00</td>
            <td>Presentations</td>
            <td>15:00</td>
            <td>Presentations</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<a name="Reflections"></a>
### Daily Reflections
We ask students to write **daily reflections** and email these to a TA by **6pm ET**. Since they will be turned in before completion of the day’s homework assignment, reflections should focus on the previous day’s homework and the current day’s lessons and lunch exercise. The purpose of reflections is threefold.
1. First, because we can’t meet in person to discuss progress and struggles, we will use the reflections to better ascertain a student’s progress over the week.
2. Second, we believe this exercise has the potential to grow a student’s understanding and confidence as they purposefully reflect and see their improvement.
3. Third, this practice directly cultivates good habits in reproducible analysis and keeping a lab notebook.

We expect these reflections to be short, but **respond to each of the following prompts**:
  * What purpose did today’s lessons, my analysis, and my coding serve?
  * How might I use what I did and learned today in the future?
  * What was my greatest struggle?
  * What was my greatest achievement?
  * What one lingering question, bemusing, or idea (on theory, syntax, etc.) do I find most perplexing or exciting? 

Notes on reflections:
  * As long as reflections attempt to respond to the above prompts, the content of the reflection will not affect a student’s grade in any way. See the [Grading](#Grading) section for further clarification.
  * We aim to keep reflections confidential. As such, only instructors, TAs, and the student will have access to a student’s reflections.

<a name="Help"></a>
## Asking for Help
We both expect and encourage you to ask questions and request help throughout this course. Everyone is learning and there is no shame in having questions, not understanding what an instructor has said or typed, or needing to debug your code. Therefore, **please ask questions** about whatever and whenever you need to. We’ve written up guidelines below on how you can ask for help during each type of session.

<a name="HelpAsynch"></a>
### Asynchronous Video Sessions
At the beginning of **asynchronous video sessions**, a TA will post a poll in #bootcamp_2020 for tracking your completion of the session. React to this message with a **:yellow_sticky:** once the poll is posted. After you finish the video, change your react to a **:green_sticky:**. Make notes of any questions you have while watching the video. When everyone has joined the Zoom call for the next session, the Lead Instructor will ask for questions regarding the video content. You can then use the “raise hand” feature in Zoom to ask questions, and the Lead Instructor will answer them directly.

<a name="HelpInter"></a>
### Interactive/ Live-Coding Sessions
During **interactive/ live-coding sessions**, one TA will be designated the Triage TA and is responsible for making sure questions are answered. The Lead Instructor for the session will announce the Triage TA at the beginning of the session, since it is a rotating role.
  * Throughout the session, **keep the `#questions_2020 Slack` channel open**.
    * If your question has already been posted by someone else and not answered in a verbal or thread response, please add a **:pink_sticky:** react to that post.
    * Perhaps your question is related to one that has already been posted. In that case, reply to the original post in a thread and add your question there. Alternatively, you can DM the Triage TA with your question and reference which post it is similar to.
    * If your question or a similar one has not been posted yet, please make a new post in `#questions_2020`. If you are not comfortable posting your question, you can DM the Triage TA, who will anonymously post it in the channel for you.
    * Note that we assume a question is “closed” once it has been answered. However, you may still be confused. In that case, please reply to the thread (and @ the Triage TA), or DM the Triage TA.
  * For most live-coding sessions, the Lead Instructor will solicit **Check Ins** every 10-15 minutes, asking students to respond to a poll in **`#bootcamp_2020`** about whether they are ready to move on to the next section.
    * **:green_sticky:** react if you’re following along and are ready to move on.
    * **:yellow_sticky:** react if you’re catching up/not ready to move on, but do not need assistance. Change to a :green_sticky: or :pink_sticky: as needed.
    * **:pink_sticky:** react if you need assistance. The Triage TA will pair an instructor or TA with you and send you to a breakout room to be helped. Once you’re ready to move on, change your react to a :green_sticky:.
    *  Once only ~2-4 students need assistance, the Triage TA will announce in Slack that we will be moving on. At this point, if you are in a breakout room, you should feel welcome to rejoin the main session and continue your discussion with the TA/instructor over Slack, or you can remain in the breakout room. If your instructor or TA thinks that your troubleshooting requires it, they will ask that the class continues to pause.
  * If the Lead Instructor prompts the class to ask questions verbally, use the “raise hand” feature in Zoom and unmute to talk.
