### Course Description
Quantitative and computational methods are increasingly essential to all sub-disciplines of modern biological research. The goal of this intensive week-long “boot camp” is to empower students with the fundamental skills to apply these methods, as well as connect them to resources for further developing their knowledge and abilities. The class starts at 10 am with formal instruction ending at 5 pm daily. The course demonstrates the importance of version control, documentation, testing, and other methods for enhancing reproducibility, reliability, and useability of software. This is achieved through live coding sessions and use of learning exercises, where for the majority of the class, students perform data analysis to address biological questions and reinforce core bioinformatic concepts. Upon completing the course, students should be comfortable using and writing software to work with large-scale biological data. The motivation of this goal is to **develop computational and statistical competence** in preparation for courses, rotations, thesis research, and careers. Rather than blindly outsourcing bioinformatic components of their work, **students will be empowered** to understand methodological details and their associated advantages and limitations. This will in turn advance the broader goal of rigor in experimental design, promoting robust and unbiased results.

<a name="Objectives"></a>
### Specific Objectives
  * Develop **comfort** working within a UNIX environment and at the command line to build and run programs
  * Develop **confidence** using Python and its extended ecosystem of tools for bioinformatic data analysis and visualization
  * Develop **knowledge** of standard bioinformatic file formats and where they fit within the context of a project
  * Develop **appreciation** for and **practice** of concise and transparent presentation of data
  * Develop **fluency** in basic statistical tests, associated assumptions, and interpretation of their output
  * Develop **good habits for ensuring reproducible research**

### Study Materials
This course does not have a required text. Any lecture notes or slides will be made available on the course website. Asynchronous videos lectures will likely be posted to YouTube and linked on the course website. Recordings of interactive lectures will be posted to a private OneDrive to which only students, instructors, and TAs will be granted access.

## Course Format

<a name="BootcampFirst"></a>
### No Other Meetings
Due to the intense nature of this course, there is a strict policy that students **cannot participate in any other meetings, courses, or lab work throughout the week.** If a student foresees problems with this, they should contact a TA immediately so that this policy can be communicated to the necessary parties.

<a name="Sessions"></a>
### Types of Sessions
The course is broke into four main **types of sessions**

1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Asynchronous **Video** Lecture Sessions</span>
    * These sessions consist of short, pre-recorded videos that introduce the lecture topic and relevant background information. The videos will be posted to YouTube (or a similar platform) and linked on the course website.
